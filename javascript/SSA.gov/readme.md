*Instructions:*

Here is the stripped down version of the page.  It just contains the table at the bottom.  The CSS and JS files need to be in separate folders one level below the index.html page.  The JSON file needs to be one level higher than the index.html. 
 
He should grab the current CSS and JS files from the public site and update the index.html below since I made a single CSS for testing.  The JS files can be downloaded directly from jQuery or use our public site.  Just make sure to update the references in the HTML page.
 
At this time we are using the reference key to create links under the title and Learn More section (should change to LandingPage but we need to review all the information).  If the reference key is not populated it will not create the links.  For the downloads column we created a new key called formatDisplay for readability.  They can change it to format but itâ€™s not very readable since they wanted the mime types.  I think the format of our JSON file matches the schema from Project Open Data.
